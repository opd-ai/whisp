# Development Plan

## Project Overview

The Whisp project is a cross-platform secure messaging application with a **complete architectural foundation** already implemented. The project has achieved approximately **85% completion of core infrastructure** with clean interfaces, proper database design, and comprehensive build system. The primary gap is transitioning from placeholder implementations to fully functional features with real Tox library integration and complete UI implementation.

**Current state**: Well-architected foundation with placeholder Tox integration, structured UI components, and comprehensive tooling.  
**Completion percentage**: 85% foundation, 15% functional implementation  
**Critical path**: Tox library integration â†’ UI completion â†’ Platform builds â†’ Security hardening

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Needed
- **Tox Library Version**: Verify compatibility with `github.com/opd-ai/toxcore` latest version
- **Database Migration Strategy**: Plan for schema updates and data migration
- **Mobile Platform Build**: Decide on Fyne mobile vs native UI approach for iOS/Android
- **File Storage Strategy**: Implement secure file storage with encryption for media files

### Technology Stack Gaps
- **Mobile Biometric Libraries**: Platform-specific biometric authentication integration
- **Notification Libraries**: Native notification system integration per platform
- **Audio Processing**: Voice message recording/playback library selection
- **File System Encryption**: Secure file storage for media and attachments

### Integration Requirements
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated building and testing
- **Code Signing**: Platform-specific code signing for distribution
- **App Store Compliance**: Ensure compliance with app store requirements
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add telemetry for performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Tox Library API Changes**: Real library may have different API than placeholder
  - *Mitigation*: Create adapter interfaces, thorough integration testing
- **Mobile Platform Restrictions**: iOS/Android app store approval challenges
  - *Mitigation*: Early compliance review, alternative distribution channels
- **Performance on Mobile**: Resource constraints may affect functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Performance profiling, optimization strategies, feature flags

### Medium Risk
- **Cross-Platform UI Consistency**: Fyne limitations on platform adaptation
  - *Mitigation*: Custom widget development, platform-specific UI branches
- **Database Migration Complexity**: Schema changes may break existing data
  - *Mitigation*: Migration testing, backup strategies, version compatibility
- **File Transfer Reliability**: Large file transfers may fail on poor connections
  - *Mitigation*: Resume capability, chunk verification, fallback protocols

### Low Risk
- **Build System Complexity**: Multiple platform builds may be fragile
  - *Mitigation*: Containerized builds, comprehensive testing, documentation
- **Configuration Management**: User preferences may not persist correctly
  - *Mitigation*: Configuration validation, default value handling, migration support
