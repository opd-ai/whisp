# Whisp Implementation Plan

## Overview

Whisp is a secure, cross-platform messaging application built with Go that provides complete feature parity across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. The implementation uses the Tox protocol for peer-to-peer messaging with end-to-end encryption.

## Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **Single Codebase**: 85%+ code reuse across all platforms
2. **Platform Adaptation**: UI adapts to platform conventions while maintaining functionality
3. **Security First**: End-to-end encryption, local data encryption, no central servers
4. **Performance**: Native performance with shared Go business logic
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all platforms

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Core Logic** | Go 1.21+ | Business logic, protocol handling |
| **UI Framework** | Fyne v2.4+ | Cross-platform native UI |
| **Protocol** | Tox (github.com/opd-ai/toxcore) | P2P messaging protocol |
| **Database** | SQLite + SQLCipher | Encrypted local storage |
| **Build System** | Make + Custom Scripts | Cross-platform building |
