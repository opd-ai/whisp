# Security Audit Report - Whisp

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted on September 19, 2025, for the Whisp cross-platform messaging application. The audit focused on identifying security vulnerabilities, assessing the effectiveness of existing security controls, and providing recommendations for improvement.

**Overall Security Rating: GOOD** - The application demonstrates strong security fundamentals with encryption, secure storage, and proper key management. However, several medium-risk vulnerabilities were identified that should be addressed.

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Cryptographic Implementation**
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for data protection
   - HKDF for key derivation
   - Scrypt for password hashing
   - Secure random number generation

2. **Database Security**
   - SQLCipher integration for encrypted storage
   - Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection
   - Proper key management and cleanup

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Platform-specific secure storage (Keychain, Credential Manager, Secret Service)
   - Encrypted file fallback for unsupported platforms
   - Master key protection with secure memory handling

4. **Access Controls**
   - Interface-based design for proper encapsulation
   - Mutex protection for shared state
   - Proper error handling and cleanup

### ⚠️ Identified Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Path Traversal Vulnerability (Medium Risk)
**Location:** `internal/core/transfer/manager.go:139`
**Issue:** File transfer code does not validate filenames for path traversal attacks
**Code:**
```go
savePath := filepath.Join(saveDir, transfer.FileName)
```

**Impact:** Malicious users could write files outside the intended directory
**Recommendation:** Sanitize filenames and validate paths

#### 2. Information Disclosure via Logging (Low Risk)
**Location:** Multiple files throughout codebase
**Issue:** Sensitive information may be logged
**Examples:**
- File paths in transfer logs
- Tox IDs in contact logs
- Transfer details in debug logs

**Impact:** Potential information leakage in logs
**Recommendation:** Implement secure logging with data sanitization

#### 3. File Permissions (Low Risk)
**Location:** `internal/core/transfer/manager.go:142`
**Issue:** Directory creation uses permissive permissions
**Code:**
```go
if err := os.MkdirAll(filepath.Dir(savePath), 0o755); err != nil {
```

**Impact:** Created directories may be world-readable
**Recommendation:** Use more restrictive permissions (0o700)

#### 4. Missing Input Validation (Low Risk)
**Location:** Various user input handling
**Issue:** Limited input validation on user-provided data
**Impact:** Potential for malformed data processing
**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive input validation

## Detailed Findings

### Cryptographic Security

**✅ PASS**
- AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption
- HKDF properly derives context-specific keys
- Scrypt parameters (N=32768, r=8, p=1) provide good resistance to brute force
- Keys are properly cleared from memory after use
- Nonce generation uses cryptographically secure random

### Network Security

**✅ PASS**
- Tox protocol provides end-to-end encryption
- No custom network protocols implemented
- Bootstrap node connections use standard networking

### Data Protection

**✅ PASS**
- Database encryption using SQLCipher
- Secure storage integration for sensitive data
- Master key derivation and storage
- Proper cleanup of sensitive data in memory

### Access Control

**✅ PASS**
- Interface-based architecture prevents direct access
- Mutex protection for concurrent access
- Proper separation of concerns

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Fix Path Traversal Vulnerability**
   ```go
   // Sanitize filename to prevent path traversal
   cleanFileName := filepath.Base(transfer.FileName)
   if cleanFileName != transfer.FileName {
       return fmt.Errorf("invalid filename: %s", transfer.FileName)
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Secure Logging**
   ```go
   // Sanitize sensitive data before logging
   log.Printf("File transfer: friend=%d, size=%d", friendID, fileSize)
   ```

### Medium Priority

3. **Restrict File Permissions**
   ```go
   if err := os.MkdirAll(filepath.Dir(savePath), 0o700); err != nil {
   ```

4. **Add Input Validation**
   - Validate Tox IDs format
   - Sanitize message content
   - Validate file sizes and types

### Low Priority

5. **Security Headers** (for future web components)
6. **Rate Limiting** (for future API endpoints)
7. **Audit Logging** (for security events)

## Compliance Assessment

### Security Best Practices Compliance

- ✅ **Encryption at Rest**: SQLCipher implementation
- ✅ **Secure Key Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage
- ✅ **Memory Safety**: Proper key cleanup
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Basic validation present
- ⚠️ **Path Security**: Needs improvement
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling
- ⚠️ **Logging Security**: Needs sanitization

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Vulnerability Testing**
   - Path traversal attack vectors
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Buffer overflow tests

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - File system access testing
   - Network protocol analysis
   - Cryptographic strength validation

3. **Security Regression Testing**
   - Automated security test suite
   - CI/CD security scanning integration

## Conclusion

The Whisp application demonstrates strong security fundamentals with robust encryption, secure storage, and proper key management. The identified vulnerabilities are primarily medium to low risk and can be addressed with targeted fixes. The application's security posture is solid and suitable for production use after implementing the recommended improvements.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement the high-priority security fixes
2. Add security-focused unit tests
3. Consider third-party security audit for production readiness
4. Implement security monitoring and alerting
