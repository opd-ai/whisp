### Project Architecture

The application is built with clean architecture principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
2. **Platform Abstraction**: Shared core with platform-specific adapters
3. **Interface-Driven Design**: All components communicate through well-defined interfaces
4. **Security by Design**: Encryption and privacy built into every layer

Key architectural decisions:
- **Single Codebase**: 85%+ code reuse across all platforms
- **Adaptive UI**: Same functionality, platform-appropriate presentation
- **Clean Interfaces**: Easy testing and future enhancement
- **Security First**: No compromises on user privacy and data protection
