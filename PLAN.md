- **File Storage Strategy**: Implement secure file storage with encryption for media files
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and UI rendering for mobile

### Technology Stack Gaps
- **Mobile Biometric Libraries**: Platform-specific biometric authentication integration
- **Notification Libraries**: Native notification system integration per platform
- **Audio Processing**: Voice message recording/playback library selection
- **File System Encryption**: Secure file storage for media and attachments

### Integration Requirements
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated building and testing
- **Code Signing**: Platform-specific code signing for distribution
- **App Store Compliance**: Ensure compliance with app store requirements
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add telemetry for performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

  - *Mitigation*: Performance profiling, optimization strategies, caching improvements
- **Mobile Platform Restrictions**: iOS/Android app store approval challenges
  - *Mitigation*: Early compliance review, alternative distribution channels
- **Performance on Mobile**: Resource constraints may affect functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Performance profiling, optimization strategies, feature flags

### Medium Risk
- **Cross-Platform UI Consistency**: Fyne limitations on platform adaptation
  - *Mitigation*: Custom widget development, platform-specific UI branches
- **Database Migration Complexity**: Schema changes may break existing data
  - *Mitigation*: Migration testing, backup strategies, version compatibility
- **File Transfer Reliability**: Large file transfers may fail on poor connections
  - *Mitigation*: Resume capability, chunk verification, fallback protocols

### Low Risk
- **Build System Complexity**: Multiple platform builds may be fragile
  - *Mitigation*: Containerized builds, comprehensive testing, documentation
- **Configuration Management**: User preferences may not persist correctly
  - *Mitigation*: Configuration validation, default value handling, migration support

## Timeline

**Total estimated completion**: 8-10 weeks

### Critical Milestones

- **Week 1**: Phase 1 complete - Database encryption working, core persistence functional
- **Week 4**: Phase 2 complete - Core UI implemented, friend management working
- **Week 7**: Phase 3 complete - Platform builds working, notifications implemented
- **Week 10**: Phase 4 complete - Advanced features implemented, ready for distribution

### Development Phases Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Foundation): 1 week - Database encryption and final foundation items
- **Phase 2** (Core Features): 3 weeks - Basic functionality complete and testable
- **Phase 3** (Platform Integration): 3 weeks - All platforms building and working

- **End of Phase 4**: Feature-complete application ready for public release

The project has an excellent foundation and clear path to completion. The architecture is sound, the Tox protocol integration is functional, dependencies are manageable, and the modular design enables incremental development with testable milestones. With Tox integration already complete, the remaining work focuses on database encryption, UI implementation, and platform optimization.
